# apis-api

A RESTful API for managing apiaries

## What

Bees don't just make honey, they make a *lot* of data.

Some years ago, I worked as a beekeepers' assistant. When I wasn't carrying boxes of equipment or being stung, I was filling in spreadsheets. That's not such an easy task.

My boss and I talked frequently about designing an app to handle this. Sadly, we never got round to it; we were too busy with the bees.

Finally, I found the time to get stuck in. so, here it is. A RESTful HTTP API for managing apiaries.

## Tools

This project uses:

- Python 3.10
